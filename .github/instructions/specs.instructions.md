# Specification Files — Read-Only Business Requirements

Files in `docs/specifications/` are **authoritative business requirements**. They are the source of truth for the entire codebase.

## Rules

- **Never modify a spec file to match existing code.** If code and spec disagree, the code is wrong.
- **Only change a spec file when there is an explicit, deliberate business decision** to do so — and that intent must be clear in the user's request. Spec changes must be reviewed separately from code changes.
- **Do not make incidental edits** to specs while working on code tasks (e.g. don't fix a spec "while you're in there").

## What each spec file governs

| File | Governs |
|------|---------|
| `specifications/prd.md` | Goals, personas, user stories — the *why* of every feature |
| `specifications/domain-model.md` | Entity names, attributes, relationships, business rules — naming must match in all code |
| `specifications/auth-matrix.md` | Which roles may perform which operations — all access control logic must match this exactly |
| `specifications/sequence-diagrams.md` | Interaction flows — the expected order of API calls and system events |
| `specifications/contracts/openapi.yaml` | REST API shapes, status codes, route paths — route handlers must conform to this |
| `specifications/contracts/asyncapi.yaml` | Domain event schemas and channel bindings |

## When asked to update a spec

Confirm the intent is a deliberate business change before editing. Ask: "This would change the authoritative spec — is this a deliberate business decision?"

## Language in specs

Use business language throughout — name user stories, operations, and events with domain verbs (e.g. "Add item to catalogue", "Archive item", "Remove item") rather than generic CRUD verbs ("Create", "Update", "Delete"). Specs should read like business requirements, not database documentation.
